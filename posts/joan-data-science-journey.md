Balancing a demanding full-time job with intensive learning isn't easy, but Joan from Barcelona proves it's possible with the right mindset and support system. As a Market Research professional, Joan saw the writing on the wall: data science skills were becoming essential in his field.

## The Challenge

Working 9-to-6 in market research meant Joan's learning had to happen during evenings and weekends. The part-time bootcamp format became his solution, offering structured learning that fit around his professional commitments.

## Making It Work

Joan's strategy involved:
- **Time blocking** - Dedicating specific hours to learning
- **Weekend projects** - Using Saturdays for deep work on bootcamp projects
- **Applying learnings immediately** - Bringing new skills to his day job
- **Building a support network** - Connecting with fellow part-time learners

## The Transformation

Within months, Joan was implementing machine learning models at work, automating reports that previously took days to compile. His employer noticed, and new opportunities began opening up.

## Key Takeaways

"The hardest part wasn't the technical concepts," Joan reflects. "It was maintaining momentum when work got busy. But seeing immediate applications of what I learned kept me motivated."

His advice for others considering a similar path: "Don't wait for the perfect time. Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can."
